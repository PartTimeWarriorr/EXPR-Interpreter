a = 1
read b
c = 3
D[x] = a + 2*b%x
print a
print b
print c
print D[c]


//
header and src separation
(easy for interpreter and arith)
(might take time for expressions)

header with global variables
(should be easy)

figure out how to build expression tree
maybe first build infix to rpn converter


2*b%c -> 2b*c%

then if interpreter reaches undefined var name -> throw error
//
